    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make sauce: Combine yogurt, cucumber, mayonnaise, dill, salt, and pepper
        in a small bowl; mix well. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make falafel: Mash chickpeas in a large bowl until thick and pasty; do
        not use a blender as the consistency will be too thin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place onion, parsley, and garlic in a blender; blend until smooth. Stir
        into mashed chickpeas until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine egg, cumin, coriander, salt, lemon juice, baking powder, black
        pepper, and cayenne in a small bowl. Stir into chickpea mixture along
        with olive oil. Mix in bread crumbs, a little at a time, until mixture
        holds together but is not sticky. Form mixture into 8 balls, then
        flatten into falafel patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 inch oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry falafels
        in hot oil until brown on both sides. Serve 2 falafels in each pita
        half, topped with chopped tomatoes and sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
